# Font Configuration
I've decided to use the JetBrainsMono font from nerdfonts
I don't know how antialias and hinting works, but the configuration manual recommends i turn it off for displays having DPI > 200
Hinting doesn't affect the font on my display, but turning off antialiasing reduces font resolution ( makes it look a bit blocky )
Default fonts can be configured using the defaulFonts option
fc-list : family can be used to see the installed fonts on the system
